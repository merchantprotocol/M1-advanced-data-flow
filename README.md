# M1-advanced-data-flow

Data exchange occupies a special place in the electronic commerce. It requires much attention and time. Therefore import / export of data should be automated as much as possible. Magento provides simple wizard-like tool for generation of some basic import / export profiles operating on products or customers entities. Magento migration processes are introduced with profiles. Each profile is a combination of actions (adapters / parsers / mappers) to transfer data from one format into another. The Magento enables customers and products (with or without an inventory) to be exported / imported using CSVM or Excel XML formats. The Advanced Dataflow Magento extension is a set of additional adapters and parsers to increase Magento Dataflow flexibility. This dataflow advanced profile extends default bounds to cover more requirements. The most essential Advanced Dataflow feature is orders import and export. It appends orders to list of available entities to migrate. Facilitate your e-business with this Magento module. Make your data exchange process with offline sale management system more flexible.
