        administration interface features powerful marketing, search engine optimization
        and catalog-management tools to give merchants the power to create sites that
        are tailored to their unique business needs. Designed to be completely scalable
        and backed by Varien's support network, Magento offers companies the ultimate
        eCommerce solution.
        Magento was launched on March 31, 2008. It was developed by Varien (now Magento Inc)
        with help from the programmers within the open source community but is owned 
        solely by Magento Inc.. Magento was built using the Zend Framework.[1][2] It 
        uses the entity-attribute-value (EAV) database model to store data.
